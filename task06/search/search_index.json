Guidance \u2217 Use the following names: Your.Name - as a home directory of your projects; task06 - as a directory of the current project; partXX - as a directory of the corresponding subtask ( XX - subtask number); src - as a sources directory. Implement a character device driver with the following requirements: 1kB buffer size; buffer increase as a module parameter; should be available for all users; works only ASCII strings. Add the interfaces into the driver: sysfs for buffer clean up; procfs for displaying used buffer volume and buffer size. Implement bash script for the driver testing. Provide a test scenario. Extra \u2217 Implemented character device should be committed to GitLab repository . During implementation, please follow to code and git style. Project Workflow Fork the repo . Clone that fork to a local repository. Add the repo as remote to your local clone (e.g. as main ). Your main branch is main/your.name , you\u2019ll share your solutions as MRs to this branch: Create a branch and add commits there. Push this branch to remote: git checkout -b branch_name # add commits here git push -u origin HEAD:branch_name Create a merge request in GitLab web interface from branch_name in your fork to your.name in the repo .
